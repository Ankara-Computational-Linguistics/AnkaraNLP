The process of weaning can be carried out so that the child himself, with a little encouragement, will choose a new and wider form of pleasure, and so pass lightly through this, the most intense, emotional experience of life. If the change, when its time comes, is violently made, desire will not go forwards to new fields and to wider experience of mind, but backwards to some substitute pleasure of the same type as the one to be surrendered. Thumb-sucking, an obvious substitute, is the commonest.

The writer states that A) it's usually the parent that surrenders to the child's desire for an unpleasant substitute B) when weaning is done forcefully, it's most commonly substituted for by thumb-sucking C) the parent should ask someone more experienced for help during the process of weaning D) the more emotional the child, the more intense his desire for breast-feeding E) the parent should be patient with the child even if he becomes rather irritable 3.

ELS 39 r Perhaps more swimmers have been drowned by cramp than by anything else, and only those who have suffered from it can conceive its fatal power. Even good swimmers, when seized with cramp, have been known to sink instantly, overcome with the sudden pain, and nothing can save the victim but the greatest presence of mind. The usual spot where the cramp is felt is the calf of the leg and it sometimes comes with such violence that the muscles are gathered up into knots. There is only one method of proceeding under such circumstances to turn on one's back at once, kick the leg out in the air, disregarding the pain, and rub the spot smartly with one hand, while the other is employed in paddling towards shore. These directions are easy enough to give, but quite difficult to obey cramp seems to deprive the sufferer of all reason for the time, and it seems to overpower him with mingled pain and terror. Therefore, the method of saving a person drowning because of cramp demands great practice. The chief difficulty lies in the fact that a person who cannot swim feels, in deep water, much as if he were falling through air, and consequently clutches instinctively at the nearest object. If he succeeds in grasping the person who is trying to save him, both will probably sink together. Every precaution should be taken to prevent such a misfortune and the drowning man should always be seized from behind and pushed forwards. 40 ELS 1. According to the passage, although the correct course of action for cramp is simple, A) the pain caused by it takes a long time to disappear B) it is clear that few people remember to follow it C) it cannot be applied without the help of another person D) barely anyone has ever survived an attack in water E) it isn't easy to put into practice 2. According to the passage, the force of cramp is so great that A) it is hopeless to try and save a victim B) only previous victims can imagine it C) rubbing the spot affected is useless D) most people affected never go swimming again E) it is impossible to move once affected 3. The author warns readers that A) one should not attempt to help someone struck by cramp B) rescuers should approach a victim head-on C) suffering cramp while swimming is almost always fatal D) rescuers can be dragged down with the victim E) once struck with cramp while swimming, the person must stay still and wait for assistance 1.

In our own culture, only very young boys may be allowed to play with their sisters' dolls occasionally without ridicule or remonstrance. And even they are rarely given dolls of their own, although teddies and stuffed animals may be allowed. A seven-year-old boy who enjoys tucking teddies up in cots is likely to be ridiculed if he does it too often. Similarly, girls do enjoy playing with toy cars and train sets, but are rarely given these as presents. Older girls particularly are discouraged from playing boisterous games and may be labelled torn-boys if they do not conform to the quieter, gentler, less aggressive activities expected of them. Boys who abstain from rough games, or prefer reading or playing the piano are in danger of being labelled sissy . adapt oneself to (phrasal verb) m) hold oneself back n) boy who behaves like a girl 42 ELS 1. It's stated in the passage that A) babies are born with certain tendencies depending on their sexes B) the child's sex is taken into consideration when it is presented with a toy C) there must be certain games which both boys and girls can play together D) it's cruel to call a child a torn-boy or a sissy when it doesn't conform to the norms of society E) boisterous or aggressive games are considered suitable for neither gender 2. According to the writer, the tendency that dominates society is that A) children should be allowed to play with whatever toy they like B) the discrimination against toys regarded as suitable for boys or girls only increases the child's interest in them C) the child should be discouraged from playing with toys special to the other sex, without the parents being too repressive D) the child should be directed from an early age to behave in accordance with its own sex E) such activities as reading and playing the piano should be common to both genders 3. We can conclude from the passage that A) psychologists are attempting to eliminate sex discrimination in society B) girls aren't given toy cars and train sets as presents, but anyway, they instinctively haven't much interest in them C) the child's choice in games and toys is directed according to the norms of society rather than D) the child only grows interested in the toys belonging to the opposite sex when there is a E) if the child's attention weren't drawn to such discrimination through prohibitions, he would to his interests member of that sex in his or her vicinity instinctively behave suitably for his own gender 1.

A very simple operation can often save them. But there is usually no prospect of such surgery in their own countries, owing to the lack of specialized expertise and technical resources. Faced with this terrible fact, says Professor Alain Deloche, a heart surgeon, a simple idea took root to bring these children to France, to provide them with operations, and then send them home, cured, to their families. To achieve this, continues Professor Deloche, one simply needs to bring into action a series of links in a chain of skills, asking people with all types of expertise to join in. This project has a powerful appeal. Everyone can participate and become a link in the chain. And so, well-known surgeons, the most highly skilled in their fields, operate free of charge in their hospitals throughout France. At the end of the chain, one finds a network of families who take the children in free of charge during their recovery.

Charles Chaplin was the most talked-about man in America, the king of silent movies. He was not only admired as a first-class actor and comedian, he was also making his name as a director. How did he reach the top of the film world in such a short time. He was not an instant success. His attempts to copy other slapstick comedians who were popular at that time were a failure. However he gradually began to develop the character of the tramp that will always be connected with his name. He borrowed ideas from many sources and though he stole most of his clothes from other slapstick comedians of the time, he developed his own special mannerisms to go with them. He used his bowler hat to signal secret messages and his walking stick allowed him to cause confusion and punish his enemy from a distance.

The desire to hurt living things generally appears in the child who has been given a strong hatred of authority. This problem of cruelty is very difficult to handle. It requires the parents to use good temper and good sense, trying to find out where the child's real interests lie and guiding its energy to these channels. Except in the worst cases, sympathetic treatment by parents and teachers will gradually suffice to cure, for it will give back self-confidence, self-love, and a belief in life, and it is the absence of these which is the cause of cruelty. hurt or punish someone when we believe wrong has been done to us (two words) g) things that make someone feel pain or unhappiness h) wish strong feeling of want i) the ability to behave well and make good decisions j) ways directions k) understanding, especially of someone's feelings I) be enough to do something, or to meet a need 48 ELS 1.

Studies have shown that sound levels from the machines can reach 115 decibels or more - roughly equivalent to standing 100 feet from a commercial jet at the moment of take-off. At that level, permanent hearing damage can occur after just 15 minutes. And the earlier a child begins using a headset, the more damage can accumulate. Loud noise causes hearing loss by killing irreplaceable hair cells in the inner ear. Normally, the process occurs slowly as people age, but noise damage can accelerate it. Noise-induced hearing loss is insidious damage may not be apparent until later in life.

Statistics from the developed countries suggest that it is only when people's living standards begin to rise that birth rates begin to fall. There are good reasons for this. Poor countries cannot afford social services and old age pensions, and people's incomes are so low they have nothing to spare for savings. Having a large family can be a form of insurance. And even while they are still quite young, children can do a lot of useful jobs on a small farm. So poor people in a developing country will need to see clear signs of much better conditions ahead before they can think of having smaller families. But their conditions cannot be improved unless there is a reduction in the rate at which population is increasing. This will depend on a very much wider acceptance of family planning and this, in turn, will mean basic changes in attitudes. a) money paid periodically by the government to people who have retired (phrase) b) wages salaries money earned, usually, from work c) money kept, often in a bank, for use at a later time d) depend or rely on someone expect or hope someone will help (phrase) e) the act of agreeing to do or use something f) as a result in proper order or sequence g) fundamental h) way of thinking or feeling 52 ELS 1. According to the writer, people in poor countries have a lot of children mainly because A) they rely on them for support during their old age B) they aren't yet prepared for family planning due to their religious beliefs C) they usually become involved with farming, which makes it easier for them to be fed D) methods of family planning are not being satisfactorily practised in those countries E) they receive government support for every child 2. The writer points out that, before deciding upon family planning A) governments of poor countries should increase the amount of old age pensions B) developed countries should help developing ones to improve their standards of living C) governments of developing countries must forbid parents to use child labour on farms D) people in poor countries want to be sure of their future E) people in poor countries must be educated by social services, being clearly shown the advantages of having fewer children 3. We can conclude from the writer's statements that birth rates in developed countries A) should be higher so that the population can meet the demand for manpower B) can't be reduced without strict family planning C) decreased as standards of living increased D) will go on increasing unless people change their attitudes radically E) are now keeping pace with economic growth 1.

In Bali, a cremation is therefore a time of joy and celebration. On the morning of the cremation, friends and relatives gather to pay their last respects and to eat and drink § with the family. There is then a procession to the cremation ground, some men carrying the corpse in a tower built of bamboo and paper, and other men carrying a special container called a sarcophagus, which may be in the shape of a cow or a bull. At the cremation ground the body is transferred to the sarcophagus and when it has been reduced to ashes and the soul released, there is a happy noisy procession to the sea, where the ashes are scattered.

The carnival was a noisy, colourful of adults and children, all wearing costumes and dancing and singing. ELS 55 The festival celebrates the traditions of the British black community, who emigrated to Great Britain from the West Indies in the 1950s. They brought with them the Caribbean idea of the carnival, with processions, colourful costumes, steel bands and street dancing. Preparations for the carnival begin many months beforehand. Costumes have to be made, and floats built, ready for the street procession. Steel bands practise traditional Caribbean music on instruments made from old oil drums. Shortly before the festival, the streets are decorated with red, green and yellow streamers, and amplifiers are set in place, to carry the rhythmic sounds over the roar of the London traffic. The carnival lasts for three days, and is full of music and colour. Processions of floats, steel and brass bands, and dancers in exotic costumes make their way through the narrow London streets, watched by thousands of people. The streets are lined with stalls selling tropical fruits, such as fresh pineapple, watermelons and mangoes. Everybody dances - black and white, young and old - and even the policemen on duty take part in the fun. For these three days in August, a little Caribbean magic touches the streets of London. 56 ELS 1.

ELS 59 Misers seem almost obsessed with the idea of saving, so they accumulate money in banks if their income is large, or in the house - stuffed in mattresses or under the living room rug - if they are lowincome people. They deprive themselves of many things and spend money just on the most essential things. Spenders are people who have a tendency to spend too much on too many unnecessary things. They are often too generous, making elaborate gifts to friends and family. Credit cards in some spenders' hands are often dangerous weapons. They become addicted to using them, only to regret it later when the bills come in and they are unable to pay. Economizers are practical people who spend wisely, usually making use of a budget. They can enjoy more and various material things and activities due to their careful utilization of funds. They spend in moderation and save in moderation for their future retirement or the education of their children.

ELS 61 In any ordinary field, two million spiders may be hard at work.They thrive in the hottest jungles and the coldest polar regions. They have been found even at the height of 22,000 feet (6,700 meters), on Mount Everest. The spider's incredible silk-spinning organs are on its abdomen. The silk thread begins as a liquid that hardens on contact with the air. A spider can make many different kinds of silk thread. Each kind has its own special purpose. By using certain tubes, or by combining the threads in different ways, a spider can make a very delicate thread or a thick, broad band of silk. Some sizes are used to line their nests or retreats. Others are used for egg cocoons, or for tying up victims, or for weaving webs. Spider silk is stronger than silkworm silk. If twisted into a rope.it can lift more weight than a rope of the same size made of iron wire. Wilson quotes an old Ethiopian proverb, When spider webs unite, they can halt a lion. Although lions have never been seen in spider webs, there does seem to be some truth in this.

ELS 63 The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him. Apart from any moral considerations, this is a stupid method of training, for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn into a man-killer. The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages, but produces a cheerful, goodtempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service. The first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single trainer who will be entirely responsible for the job. Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection. There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death when, by some unavoidable circumstance, they have been deprived of their own trainer. Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt, but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and trainer is the key to successful training. don't take too seriously don't believe something is completely true (phrase) 64 ELS Choose the correct answer according to the passage. 1.

The miner was so pleased with his pants that he told other miners about the wonderful new Levi's pants or Levis, and soon Levi Strauss had to open a shop to manufacture enough trousers for the miners. The miners wanted trousers that were comfortable to ride in, that were low-cut so they could bend over easily to pick up the gold from under their feet, and which had big useful pockets.

ELS 73 In 1960, an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye-movements during sleep. He showed that the average individual's sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eyemovement, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid. People woken during these periods of eye-movement generally reported that they had been dreaming. When woken at other times they reported no dreams. If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movement sleep for several nights on end, and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time but when they were not exhibiting eye-movements, the first group began to show some personality disorders, while the others seemed more or less unaffected.
